  <h1>About Demu</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Demu, your friendly online store demo built with Ruby on Rails.</p>

  <p>This project is a showcase of e-commerce functionality including product browsing, categories, user reviews, and order management.</p>

  <p>It is built as part of my web development learning journey, featuring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rails MVC architecture</li>
    <li>Database relationships like users, products, categories, orders, and reviews</li>
    <li>Integration with external APIs for products data</li>
    <li>Pagination with Kaminari</li>
    <li>Responsive UI with Bootstrap</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feel free to browse products, leave reviews, and explore the site. This is a demo so no real orders will be processed.</p>
